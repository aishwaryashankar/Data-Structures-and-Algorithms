Variables
- slot in memory to hold value
- declared
- assignment
- Java = statically-typed so variables need to be declared before being used
- 4 types of variables: instance (non-static), class (static), local, parameters
- instanceof operator to check if a variable is of a certain type (ie. boolean result = str instanceof String)
- ternary operator - aka conditional operator ; variable = Expression ? expression1 : expression2; 

Scanner (input)
- import java.util.Scanner
- use with nextInt(), nextDouble(), next() methods

Control Flow in Java
- if..else if...else
- switch statement - uses breaks
- for loop
- for-each loop (to loop over arrays and collections)
- while loop

break and continue
- used to skip over some code
- break - terminates the loop immediately and program control goes to statement following the loop
in case of nested loops, if break statement is in the inner loop, it breaks out of it and control goes back to the outer loop
- continue - skips the current iteration of the loop

Array
- collection of same data type items
- declaration + initialization
- elements accessed using index
- can have single or multidimensional arrays

Java OOP
- classes have fields (state) and behaviors (methods)
- object = instance of a class

Inheritance
- main purpose = code reusability because code in parent class can be used by child class

Exception
- unexpected event that occurs during program execution 
- some things that can cause exceptions: invalid user input, device failure, code errors, opening unavailable
file, etc...
- exceptions can be caught and handled by the program
